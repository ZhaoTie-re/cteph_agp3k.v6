# Purpose : Single source of truth for the assoc_plink2 figure aesthetic.
#             - one canonical publication style (Arial, 600 dpi, despined)
#             - a SEMANTIC palette: colour is assigned by what a mark MEANS, so
#               the same meaning is never two colours across figures
#             - the measured, collision-free layout engine (caption block, left
#               margin, value labels, label separation, legend placement)
#             - the GWAS-specific helpers (LD r^2 bins, thresholds, lambda_GC)
#           Imported as a sibling module (ScriptDir is sys.path[0] when Nextflow
#           runs `python3 ${ScriptDir}/x.py`), so no packaging is needed.
# Component: assoc_plink2 — common-variant association scan
